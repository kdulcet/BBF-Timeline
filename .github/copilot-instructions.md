**CONCRETE AND HIGHLTY SPECIFIC COPILOT BEHAVIOR INSTRUCTIONS**

* SCOPE. *SCOPE*. **SCOPE**. ****SCOPE****. DO *NOT* do ANYTHING outside of a prompt.
* *FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER*: This means do NOT add your own FEATURES OR INTERPRETATIONS. If you have an idea or a suggestions, ***ASK***, do not ***DO***.
* Do not perform a commit under any circumstances unless you have specifically been asked to do so in the current prompt.
* **CRITICAL: When running git commands (commit, push, etc), ALWAYS use isBackground:true in run_in_terminal** - git commands hang without this!
* Obey the current prompt specifically and **NO MORE**. GO NO FURTHER. *STOP*.
* Make no assumptions whatsoever as to ANYTHING outside of the prompt.
* Suggestions are WELCOME, your unwanted code explorations ARE NOT.
* IF THERE IS **ANY QUESTION** about a file, do NOT modify it. **REFER DIRECTLY TO THE REPOSITORY VERSION**.
* If the prompt says it doesn't work, it doesn't work: DO NOT launch a Python browser to test .
* DO NOT CREATE YOUR OWN TESTS unless specifically asked.
* DO NOT OVERACHIEVE. SIMPLY ACHIEVE. THAT'S ENOUGH.
* docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and docs/CSS_STYLEGUIDE.md are the top-level references.
