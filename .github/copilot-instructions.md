**CONCRETE AND HIGHLTY SPECIFIC COPILOT BEHAVIOR INSTRUCTIONS**

* Do *not* perform a commit under any circumstances unless you have specifically been asked to do so in the current prompt.
* **IMPORTANT: When running git commands (commit, push, etc), ALWAYS use isBackground:true in run_in_terminal** - git commands hang without this!
* Make no assumptions whatsoever as to ANYTHING outside of the prompt
* If I say it doesn't work, it doesn't work. We troubleshoot until I say we have something that works.

** SCOPE. *SCOPE*. **SCOPE**. ****SCOPE****. DO *NOT* do ANYTHING outside of a prompt.
